        <h1>Project Overview:</h1>
        <h2>The Book Shop Management System is a software solution designed to automate and manage the operations 
          of a bookshop. This system enables users to perform essential tasks such as adding new books, managing 
          inventory, processing sales, and generating reports efficiently. The goal is to minimize manual effort,
           ensure inventory accuracy, and provide a seamless experience for both shop owners and customers.</h2>
           <h1>Key Features:</h1>

           <ul>
 <li><h2>Inventory Management:- Keep track of all books in the store, including adding, updating, and deleting book records. </h2></li>
<li><h2>Sales Management:- Facilitate the checkout process with automated pricing, discounts, and receipts.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Customer Management:- Store and retrieve customer details, and manage their purchase history.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Reporting:- Generate detailed reports of sales, inventory, and customer behavior to help shop owners make informed decisions.</h2></li>
<li><h2>User-friendly Interface:- Easy navigation for both shop staff and customers, ensuring efficient operations.</h2></li>
           </ul>
       <h1>Technologies Used:</h1>  
       <ul>
        <li><h2>Java: Core language for the backend logic and application functionality.</h2></li>
        <li><h2>MySQL: Database for storing book inventory, sales records, and customer data.</h2></li>
        <li><h2>JavaFX: Used to design the desktop application's graphical user interface (GUI), offering a modern and flexible UI experience.</h2></li>
        <li><h2>JDBC: Java Database Connectivity to interact with the MySQL database.</h2></li>
       </ul>  
    
       <h1>Challenges and Solutions:</h1>
       <ul>
        <li><h2>Data Management:- One of the main challenges was ensuring data consistency across the application, particularly with sales and inventory updates. 
          This was resolved by implementing appropriate database constraints and transaction management techniques.</h2></li>
      <li><h2>User Experience: To create a smooth and responsive UI, we optimized the layout and focused on reducing the complexity of navigating between different functionalities.</h2></li>
      </ul>
